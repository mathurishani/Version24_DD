# House Price Prediction Model
A machine learning model to predict house prices based on features such as location, size, number of rooms, etc.

## About
This project aims to develop a machine learning model using Keras to predict house prices. The model will be trained on the Boston Housing Price dataset, which contains information about various features of houses in Boston and their corresponding prices.

## Requirements
1. Dataset Acquisition: Obtain the Boston Housing Price dataset containing information about houses.
2. Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the dataset to handle missing values, categorical variables, and feature scaling (optional but recommended).
3. Model Training: Train a regression model (e.g., linear regression, decision trees, or ensemble methods) using Keras to predict house prices.
4. Evaluation: Evaluate the model's performance using metrics such as mean squared error (MSE) or mean absolute error (MAE).

## Dataset
The Boston Housing Price dataset can be found in the keras.datasets module. It contains 506 instances with 13 numeric/categorical predictive attributes and the median value of owner-occupied homes in $1000s (the target variable).
